In addition to the mandatory best practices, the four optional ones we chose
were:

    #6 - Build Tools
            We used Visual Studio's XML-based build format for the project
            generator.  The files can be inspected at 
            ProjectGenerator/ProjectGenerator.sln and
            ProjectGenerator/ProjectGenerator/ProjectGenerator.csproj .

            We used a Makefile for the parser/analyzer (if you think about it,
            this is pretty meta; thankfully, we have little to build for this
            component and the file itself is nearly trivial, doing only cleanup
            of transient files that exist during testing). 

    #7 - Unit tests
            We used the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) standard for unit tests,
            via Perl's Test::More library.  The tests are in the t/ directory.
            Additionally, the 'prove' utility (which should be installed with
            any recent version of Perl) can be used to automatically run all the
            tests and print a report of the results.

    #8 - Mock Objects
            We used the CPAN module Test::MockObject to facilitate object
            mocking for unit testing purposes.

    #11- Third-Party Component
            We used many third-party components.  The largest was the CPAN
            module Makefile::Parser::GMakeDB .  We also used the open-source
            graph visualization tool GraphViz (and its accompanying CPAN
            module), XML::TreePP, and HTML::Template.  These open-source
            libraries can all be browsed via http://search.cpan.org .
