For C#, we have adopted the MSDN coding standards.


For ASP, we have adopted MSDN's VBScript coding conventions.

For Perl, we have adopted the language's conventional coding standard as
documented in `perldoc perlstyle`, with the addendum that Moose's coding
standards apply to all object-oriented code.



For all languages, we have adopted the documentation standard that the header on
our group's Google Docs should be included for all driver and library files (ie.
everything but tests and auxiliary files).
